# Gas Calculator Project

This project is a simple JavaScript application that helps determine whether you need to stop for gas based on your car's current fuel level, tank size, and miles per gallon (MPG).

## Features

- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter information about their car, including the tank size in gallons, current fuel level as a percentage, and miles per gallon (MPG).
- **Calculation:** Calculates the number of miles the car can travel with the current amount of gas.
- **Decision Making:** Determines whether the car can travel at least 200 miles without refueling.
- **Output:** Displays a message and an image based on whether the car can reach 200 miles without refueling or needs to stop for gas.
